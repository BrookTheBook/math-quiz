# High School Math Quiz

We created a math quiz for high schoolers using html, css, and javascript.

## Inspiration
We was inspired by the educational track. We thought that most students struggle with math, so we created a quiz for them to practice with.

## What it does
It's a quiz. On the side, we tried to create a calculator, but it's a work in progress. After you click submit, It gives you the score a the bottom.

## How I built it
We created it using html, javascript, and css. I followed [this tutorial](https://codeactually.com/interactivequiz.html) to figure out how to create the quiz.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was figuring out how to create a side panel for the calculator. We found a tutorial on w3schools.com, and used it to create a side panel.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We're proud of everything we made.

## What I learned
We learned how to creat a quiz in html, css, and javascript.

## What's next for High School Math quiz
We're going to add more questions and create a calculator in the side panel.
